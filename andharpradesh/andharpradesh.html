            <h3>
                Andhra Pradesh, located in the southeastern part of India, is a state known for its rich history,<br> diverse culture, and significant contributions to the economy and art. It is bordered by Telangana, Tamil Nadu,<br> Karnataka, Odisha, and the Bay of Bengal to the east. <br><br>


The state is historically significant, with a legacy that includes ancient kingdoms such as the <br>Satavahanas, Ikshvakus, and Vijayanagara Empire. Andhra Pradesh has a rich cultural heritage,<br> particularly in classical dance and music. Kuchipudi, one of the eight classical dance forms of India, originated here. <br><br>

Economically, Andhra Pradesh is one of India's key states, with agriculture playing a central role. <br>The state is one of the largest producers of rice, earning it the nickname "Rice Bowl of India."<br> In recent years, Andhra Pradesh has also developed a strong industrial base,<br> especially in information technology, pharmaceuticals, and textiles. <br><br>

The state boasts diverse geography, from coastal plains to hills and forests. Its long coastline along the <br> Bay of Bengal includes popular beaches like Visakhapatnam and unique ecosystems like the Coringa mangrove forests. <br> The Godavari and Krishna rivers are vital lifelines, supporting agriculture and drinking water needs. <br><br>

Visakhapatnam, often called Vizag, is the largest city and a major industrial hub, while Amaravati is  <br>being developed as the new state capital. Andhra Pradesh is also known for its rich cuisine, marked by spicy and flavorful dishes,<br> and its vibrant festivals, such as Ugadi, Sankranti, and the famous Tirupati Venkateswara Temple festival. <br><br>

The state, like many in India, faces challenges such as managing urbanization, <br>ensuring equitable development, and dealing with natural disasters, especially cyclones that frequently hit its coastline.</h3>
