Chhattisgarh is a major producer of minerals like coal, iron ore, and bauxite, contributing significantly <br> to India’s industrial sectors, especially steel and power. Agriculture, particularly rice cultivation, is also vital, <br>earning it the nickname "Rice Bowl of India." <br><br>

The state's population is diverse, with a significant proportion of indigenous tribes, known as Adivasis, <br> contributing to its rich cultural tapestry. Chhattisgarh is known for its folk traditions, such as the Pandavani <br> storytelling and Raut Nacha dance. <br> Natural attractions like Chitrakote Falls and Kanger Valley National Park,<br> along with its wildlife sanctuaries, make it a unique destination for tourists. <br><br>
