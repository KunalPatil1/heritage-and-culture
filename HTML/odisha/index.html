                Odisha, located on the eastern coast of India, is known for its rich cultural heritage, diverse <br>landscapes, and vibrant traditions.
                 It is bordered by the Bay of Bengal to the east, and the states of<br> West Bengal, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, and Andhra Pradesh.<br><br>
                
                The state is famous for its ancient temples, such as the Jagannath Temple in Puri, the Sun Temple <br>in Konark (a UNESCO World Heritage Site), and the Lingaraja Temple in Bhubaneswar.
                 Odisha is also<br> known for its classical dance form, Odissi, which is one of the eight classical dance forms of India.<br><br>
                
                Economically, Odisha has a strong agricultural base, with rice being the major crop. 
                It is also rich in<br> natural resources, particularly minerals like iron ore, coal, bauxite, and chromite, which contribute <br>significantly to its industrial output.<br><br>
                
                Odisha is home to several indigenous tribes, each with its unique customs, languages, and traditions.<br> The state's natural beauty is reflected in its scenic landscapes, including beaches, lakes, waterfalls,<br> and wildlife sanctuaries.
              Chilika Lake, Asia's largest brackish water lagoon, <br>is a prominent ecological hotspot in the region.<br><br>
                
                Despite its natural and cultural wealth, Odisha faces challenges such as poverty and natural disasters<br> like cyclones, which impact the state's development efforts</h3>
